# Implementation
- [ ] get finest level of detail possible, like gpx
- [ ] get and cache data (make sure no repeated API calls are made)
- [ ] inputs for filtering (exposing `df.query`?)

# Viz
- [x] marker style per activity type
- [x] HR plot
- [x] clicked activity to display more info
- [ ] pace zones vs hr (across multiple runs)
- [ ] pie chart for activities in a time window
- [ ] aggregations per time window
